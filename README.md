## üìù Notes

One of the biggest challenges I faced during the development of the website was keeping track of the logic in my code, particularly when using built-in JavaScript functions such as `filter()` and `reduce()`, as well as operators like the spread operator. It was sometimes tricky to ensure that these functions and operators were being applied correctly, especially when dealing with different declared variables.

To overcome this, I made sure to thoroughly document each JavaScript topic I encountered during the prework challenges. As I read through online documentation, I recorded my notes in Obsidian, which helped me understand the concepts more deeply. Additionally, to debug my code and better understand the output, I frequently used `console.log()`. This allowed me to track the flow of data through my program and quickly identify and fix any issues in the logic.

Through this process, I not only strengthened my understanding of JavaScript but also gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of DOM manipulation. Furthermore, I became more familiar with the terminology in JavaScript, such as "template literals" and the "ternary operator," which I had used before but never fully understood the proper terms for.
